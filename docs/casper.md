# Casper tour

**Casper** is personal firmware for the **Xteink X3/X4**, built on
[CrossPoint Reader](https://github.com/crosspoint-reader/crosspoint-reader).
It keeps a solid EPUB/TXT reading core, then layers Casper branding and a
reading-first UI: **Penumbra** and **Bare** home themes, redesigned reader
chrome, reading stats, flexible controls, and offline dictionary lookup with
multi-word selection.

<h2 align="center">Themes</h2>

<p align="center">
  Choose under <strong>Settings → Display → Theme</strong>.
</p>

| Penumbra (X3) | Penumbra (X4) | Bare |
|:-------------:|:-------------:|:----:|
| <img src="./images/casper/x3-penumbra-home.jpg" alt="Penumbra home on X3" width="240" /> | <img src="./images/casper/x4-penumbra-home.jpg" alt="Penumbra home on X4" width="240" /> | <img src="./images/casper/bare-home.jpg" alt="Casper Bare theme home" width="240" /> |

### Penumbra

Text-first home. **X3** shows a large clock and weekday with under-panels
(**Title · Recents · Book Stats · Lifetime**). **X4** shows last-read title
above a Recents list. Front actions: **Menu · Library · Recents · Read**.

| Recents | Book Stats | Lifetime |
|:-------:|:----------:|:--------:|
| <img src="./images/casper/x3-penumbra-recents.jpg" alt="Penumbra Recents" width="220" /> | <img src="./images/casper/x3-penumbra-book-stats.jpg" alt="Penumbra Book Stats" width="220" /> | <img src="./images/casper/x3-penumbra-life-stats.jpg" alt="Penumbra Lifetime Stats" width="220" /> |

### Bare

Designed for readers who simply want it to feel like **them and their book** —
a large cover, title and author, minimal chrome (same on X3 and X4). Front
actions: **Menu · Library · Recents · Read**.

- Long-press **Menu** → Settings  
- Long-press **Read** → book quick menu  

> **Note:** Clock and weekday on Penumbra need the **X3** RTC (the X4 has no RTC).

### Synopsis view

From the book quick menu (or library long-press), open a short description of
the current book without diving into the file browser. Needs synopsis metadata
(easy to add in Calibre).

<img src="./images/casper/synopsis-view.jpg" alt="Casper book synopsis view" width="360" />

*Synopsis — title and blurb for the focused book.*

---

## Reading view

Chrome stays small so the page stays the focus: battery, clock, progress,
time left, chapter, and page number. Six independent slots (upper / lower ×
left / middle / right) are editable under **Customize Reader UI**.

<img src="./images/casper/reader-ui.jpg" alt="Casper reading view with status bar chrome" width="360" />

*Reader — top battery / clock / percent; bottom time left, chapter, Pg. n/m.*

---

## Reading stats

Full **Reading Stats** for the current book, plus device lifetime charts.

<img src="./images/casper/reading-stats.jpg" alt="Per-book reading stats with charts" width="360" />

*Per-book stats — sessions, time, progress, pace, start / est. finish, habit charts.*

<img src="./images/casper/lifetime-stats.jpg" alt="Device lifetime reading stats with charts" width="360" />

*This device — lifetime totals plus time-of-day and day-of-week breakdowns.*

Tracking can be turned off under **Settings → System → Stats** for a
distraction-free setup. Auto backup and **Backup Now** live there too.

---

## Controls

Defaults tuned for everyday use: short power sleeps, long power refreshes,
long-press menu opens the dictionary. Buttons are fully remappable.

<img src="./images/casper/controls.jpg" alt="Settings Controls tab" width="360" />

*Settings → Controls — Short-Press Power = Sleep, Long-Press Menu = Dictionary.*

---

## Settings overview

Tabbed **Settings** with Display, Reader, Controls, and System categories.

<img src="./images/casper/settings.jpg" alt="Casper Settings screen" width="360" />

*Settings — Display tab with Theme, Status Bar, Sleep Screen, and more.*

---

## Customize Reader UI

Slot-based reader chrome with live preview: battery modes, progress bar,
page counters, titles, and time left — independent of the system status bar.

<img src="./images/casper/customize-reader-ui.jpg" alt="Customize Reader UI six-slot editor" width="360" />

*Customize Reader UI — six exclusive slots and nested battery display modes.*

---

## Manage Fonts

Tabs for **Font · Size · Layout · Style**, roughly 50/50 list vs live preview.
Default built-ins: **Source Serif 4** and **Bitter**. Download Fonts is a row
in the Font list.

<img src="./images/casper/manage-fonts.jpg" alt="Manage Fonts text settings" width="360" />

*Manage Fonts — live preview of family, size, and layout.*

---

## Dictionary

Offline packs on the SD card. Multi-select which dictionaries cascade on lookup.
Install by extracting a `.dictionaries` folder to the root of the SD card.

### Pack selection

<img src="./images/casper/dictionary-settings.jpg" alt="Dictionary pack multi-select screen" width="360" />

*Dictionary settings — enable English, English–Spanish, Spanish–English packs.*

### Definition card

One lookup can show English senses and a bilingual gloss in the same card,
with pronunciation beside the headword. Long entries scroll inside a card that
stays clear of the status bar and menu.

<img src="./images/casper/dictionary-lookup.jpg" alt="Dictionary definition card" width="360" />

*Dictionary lookup — headword, pronunciation, and multi-pack senses.*

### Spanish clitics

Forms like **ayúdame** resolve to the verb stem with a natural “help me” line.

<img src="./images/casper/spanish-english.jpg" alt="Dictionary card for ayudar from Spanish clitic" width="360" />

*`Ayúdame` → ayudar / help me (Spanish–English).*

### Multi-word selection

Long-press **Select** to arm a range, move with Left/Right, short **Select** to
look up the phrase (e.g. collocations like `por favor`).

<img src="./images/casper/multi-word-selection.jpg" alt="Multi-word selection of por favor" width="360" />

*Multi-word selection — `por favor` → “please”.*

More install detail: [Dictionary](./dictionary.md).
