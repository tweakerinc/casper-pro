# Publish a built firmware into dist/ with a sequential, sortable name.
#
# Naming: dist/Casper-<NNNN>-<shortsha>.bin
#   NNNN is a zero-padded counter kept in dist/.build-number, so `ls` always
#   lists builds oldest -> newest. The short SHA keeps each build traceable to
#   a commit without having to remember which hash was which.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/dist_bin.sh [env]        # env defaults to gh_release
#
# Example:
#   scripts/dist_bin.sh gh_release   -> dist/Casper-0007-79219c65.bin
