// Getting one chapter's IR into a RivuletEngine.
//
// This is the pipeline that used to live inside RivuletReaderActivity::loadSpine:
//   cached .rvir (validated against the on-disk HTML)  ->  page map load + scrub
//   else  ZIP inflate -> SD -> read into RAM under a framebuffer loan -> HtmlToIr
//         -> persist IR, drop any map built from an older/partial convert
//
// It is separate from the reader activity so other callers can use it — the Home
// screen indexes chapters while no book is open, where nothing has to be evicted
// to make room and free heap is at its highest. Doing that from inside the reader
// meant swapping the resident chapter out from under someone who was reading.
//
// Deliberately does NOT lay out or paint anything: callers decide what to do with
// the loaded chapter (show a page, walk a page map, ...).
